# Object Disambiguation Research

This is a repository of code from a research project on how autonomous assistants can disambiguate and interpret the prepositional phrases used by humans. I conducted this research with a professor and Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado Boulder for my Science Research Seminar class -- a course I completed in 11th grade of high school.

For eight months, I worked to define and develop the project. This artificial intelligence research involved figuring out how to use Vicon tracking software, the Linux operating system, and Python machine learning toolkits.
