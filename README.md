# Object Disambiguation Research

This is a repository of code from my machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) research project on how autonomous assistants can disambiguate and interpret the prepositional phrases used by humans. At its core, the project attempted to utilize algorithms to relate real-world objects to natural language phrases. I conducted this research with a professor and Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado Boulder for my Science Research Seminar class -- a course I completed in 11th grade of high school.

For eight months, I worked to define and develop the project. This artificial intelligence research involved figuring out how to use Vicon tracking software, the Linux operating system, and Python machine learning toolkits.
